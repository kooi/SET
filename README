This program is a clone GUI application of the SET Puzzle Card Game completely written in Python 2.6.

To run this program, simply cd into the src folder and run the following command:

$ python SETMain.py

This is assuming that your Python interpreter has the Tkinter GUI toolkit properly configured.


Boring story behind the project:

I started this project back in the Summer of 2010 after doing some of the SET puzzles on the website.
However, because of my lack of knowledge with the Tkinter toolkit, I left it to die after writing it
for a few weeks. I later came across this project a few days ago and scrapped it and rewrote it in 2 days.

This program was my introduction to GUI Programming in general. The difficult part of writing this was
figuring out the Tkinter API, as well as designing how the gaming backend interface communicated with
the GUI frontend of the program.

/Boring story

From the rules page of the SET website (www.setgame.com):

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The object of the game is to identify a 'set' of three cards from 12 cards laid out on the table. Each card has a variation of the following four features:

(A) Color:
Each card is red, green, or purple.

(B) Symbol:
Each card contains ovals, squiggles, or diamonds.

(C) Number:
Each card has one, two, or three symbols.

(D) Shading: Each card is solid, open, or striped.

A 'Set' consists of three cards in which each feature is EITHER the same on each card OR is different on each card.
That is to say, any feature in the 'Set' of three cards is either common to all three cards or is different on each card.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The gameplay is primarily based on the SET daily puzzle on the SET website.

For more in-depth information, see: http://www.setgame.com/set/rules_set.htm

A good amount of features are currently written in the game such as:

- Beginner, Novice, and Advanced difficulties.
{Beginner = 27 card deck where all cards have solid shading and 9 cards on the field and 4 sets to find.
Novice = All 81 cards with 9 cards on the field and 4 sets to find.
Advanced All 81 cards with 12 cards on the field and 6 sets to find.}

- Untimed Mode for players who don't want to be pressured while playing the game.

Ok, it's still a work in progress, as I intend to introduce these features:

- Timed Mode for those who do want to be pressured while playing the game.

- Hint feature for those who tend to go crazy trying to solve a puzzle.
