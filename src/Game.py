class Game(object):

    ## Game constructor
    # @param self The object pointer
    ## @var numSetsMade
    # The total number of sets the user has made so far.
    ## @var setsListTotal
    # A list of Sets the Game object maintains when it scans the field during game initialization.
    # This data field is primarily used to test the correctness of the sets from the field.
    ## @var setsMadeSoFar
    # A list that keeps track of the sets the user has made so far.
    ## @var numSetsTotal
    # The absolute total number of sets that are on the field to be found.
    ## @var cardChoices
    # A list that keeps track of the current set choices the users has made.
    # Once the user has made 3 card choices (i.e. len(cardChoices) == 3), the Game Object verifies the Set.
    ## @var BeginnersDeck
    # A Deck object which contains cards of only solid shadings (27 cards in this deck). This deck is used only in the Beginner Level
    ## @var NormalDeck
    # A Deck object which contains all possible features (81 cards in this deck). This deck is used only in the Novice and Advanced Level.
    # This deck is used by default.
    ## @var UseDeck
    # References one of the 2 decks above based on the mode the user chooses to play in.

    # Flag that determines whether the game should be in beginner mode. gamediff cannot be 1 or 2 if beginnerFlag is True.

    # Difficulty of the Game itself (a.k.a. the number of cards), Beginner/Novice uses 9 cards on the field, Advanced uses 12.
    # Default difficulty is Novice. (0 = Beginner and beginnerFlag = True, 0 = Novice and beginnerFlag = False, 2 = Advanced)
    ## @var timediff
    # Determines the difficulty of timed mode.
    # Easy by default when timed mode is turned on (0 = Easy, 1 = Medium, 2 = Hard).
    # Higher difficulties means less time to find sets. Game is in untimed mode by default

    # An instance of a Field object that the Game object uses to scan for sets,
    # reference field indices for card choices, etc.
